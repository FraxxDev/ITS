## 1. Securities (Titoli di Credito)

> **Definition:** Security as financial security is a piece of paper (a document that holds a right).

### Securities Characteristics
*   **Literalness:** The right is exactly what is written on the security.
*   **Independent:** The owner of the security, if he decides to, can make it freely circulate. 
    *   There can be restrictions: for example, S.P.A.s can decide not to make it circulate (or limit it), and in that case, it's not independent or it's partially independent.
*   **Abstract vs Causal:**
    *   **Causal relationship:** When you know the reason why a security was issued (the underlying deal is visible).
    *   **Abstract relationship:** When you don't know the reason why a security was issued. This is when the security is considered **Abstract**.

### How Securities Circulate
1.  **Bearer Securities** (*Titoli al portatore*):
    *   Can circulate freely **ONLY hand by hand**, like banknotes. Possession equals ownership.
2.  **Securities to Order** (*Titoli all'ordine*):
    *   They can circulate but not freely like bearer securities.
    *   **Endorsement** (*La Girata*): To make them circulate, we must certify the transfer by writing that the document goes from one person to another.
    *   *Examples:* Cheques (*Assegni*), Bills of Exchange.
3.  **Registered Securities**:
    *   Example: When a company emits a bond.
    *   To make it circulate, the owner has to ask the company to sell the bond and then **register this activity in a special register** held by the company, which says that now the owner has changed.

### Examples of Securities

#### A. Bill of Exchange (Cambiale)
They are *Securities to Order* and can be of two types:

*   **Draft Bill (Cambiale Tratta):** Has three entities.
    *   **Drafter:** The person who emits the draft bill.
    *   **Draftee:** The person who pays.
    *   **Holder:** The person who holds the security itself.
    *   *Scenario:* Person A owes money to Person B, and Person B owes money to Person C. They decide to make Person A pay Person C directly.
    *   *Note:* This is done with a deadline. They can also have a "warranty" (Aval) which makes the drafter pay if the draftee doesn't.
*   **Promissory Note (Pagherò):** Has two entities.
    *   **Drafter:** The person who emits the promissory note and promises to pay.
    *   **Holder:** The person who holds the final security.
    *   *Definition:* A legal document that contains a promise of the drafter to pay at a certain deadline.

> **Note:** Being securities to order, both can be **endorsed** before the deadline to change the final destination by the holders.

#### B. Cheques (Assegni)
*   **Bank Cheque:** This is just like a *Draft Bill* where the bank acts as the Draftee.
*   **Banker Cheque (Assegno Circolare):** This is emitted for a specific reason by the bank to the final holder. It usually involves big amounts of money and is very secure because the bank guarantees it.

## 2. Financial Statement (Bilancio)

>A set of documents describing the economic and financial health of a company at the end of the fiscal year.


The financial statement follows strict principles.

### Documents of the Financial Statement
1.  **Balance Sheet:** Describes the financial aspect of the company (Assets vs Liabilities). It is a table.
2.  **Income Statement:** Document where we calculate the final result of the fiscal year (Profit or Loss). It is a table.
3.  **Supplementary Note:** Here we explain *how* we calculated most of the results in the balance sheet and income statement. It's a "guide" on how to read the tables.
4.  **Cashflow report:** Describes the movements of cash (liquidity).

### Principles (Art. 2423 Civil Code)

#### Basic Principles
*   **Clear:** It has to follow a common structure described in the law (Art. 2424 for Balance Sheet, 2425 for Income Statement). It must be clear so we can compare different statements.
*   **Correct:** It must follow the accountancy principles.
*   **True:** It has to represent the reality of the company following the law.

#### Further Principles (Approfondimenti)
*   **Prudence:** Give the right importance to risks.
    *   *Explanation:* You must count **losses** even if you only fear they might happen, but you can only count **profits** if you are 100% sure you made them (realized). You don't overestimate your wealth.
*   **Continuity (Going Concern):** 
    *   *Explanation:* When you value the items in the balance sheet, you must assume the company will **continue to work** in the future. You don't value things based on how much you would get if you sold everything today (liquidation).
*   **Competence (Accrual Basis):** 
    *   *Explanation:* You must count financial events in the fiscal year they belong to **economically**, not when the money actually moves.
    *   *Example:* If you sell a service in 2024 but get paid in 2025, the revenue belongs to the 2024 statement.
*   **Continuity of Assessment Criteria (Consistency):**
    *   *Explanation:* You cannot change the way you calculate things from one year to another. If you change the rules every year, you cannot compare the results.
