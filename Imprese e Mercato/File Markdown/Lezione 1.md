## 5. Financing: Equity vs. Debt (Deep Dive)

How does a company get money?

### 1. Equity (Ownership)
*   **Instrument:** **Shares** (SRL) or **Stocks** (SPA).
*   **Role:** The investor becomes a **Shareholder** (*Socio*).
*   **Risk:** High. If the company goes bankrupt, you lose the investment.
*   **Reward:** Dividends (only if there is profit).

### 2. Debt (Loans/Bonds)
*   **Instrument:** **Bonds** (*Obbligazioni*) or Bank Loans.
*   **Role:** The investor becomes a **Creditor** (*Creditore*).
*   **Risk:** Lower. You have the right to be reimbursed at the deadline + interest, regardless of profit.

#### Rules on Bonds (*Obbligazioni*)
Bonds are "parts of debt" issued by the company to the market.

*   **S.P.A. (Stocks):** Can issue **Bonds**.
    *   **The Limit:** An SPA cannot issue bonds exceeding **twice** the value of its (Capital Stock + Legal Reserves).
    *   *Rationale:* To prevent the company from borrowing too much compared to its actual net worth.
    *   *Exception:* The limit can be exceeded if the bonds are listed on regulated markets or bought by professional investors (banks).

*   **S.R.L. (Shares):** Traditionally cannot issue bonds to the public.
    *   They can issue **Debt Securities** (*Titoli di Debito*), but these can **only** be subscribed by **professional investors** (like banks), not by regular individuals. This is to protect small savers from risky investments in smaller companies.
