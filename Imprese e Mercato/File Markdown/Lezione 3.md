## 1. Balance Sheet (Stato Patrimoniale)
> **Reference:** Art. 2424 of the Civil Code.

It represents the static situation of the company at a specific moment (usually 31/12).
**Total Assets must always equal Total Liabilities.**

| Assets (Attivo) | Liabilities (Passivo) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A) Due from Shareholders** | **A) Net Capital (Equity)** |
| **B) Fixed Assets** | **B) Provisions for risks and charges** |
| **C) Current Assets** | **C) Employee Termination Indemnity (TFR)** |
| **D) Accruals (Positive)** | **D) Debts** |
| | **E) Accruals (Negative)** |
| **TOTAL ASSETS** | **TOTAL LIABILITIES** |

### Detailed Analysis of Assets (Attivo)
Assets are positive values for the company (what we own or are owed).

1.  **Due from Shareholders (Crediti verso soci):**
    *   Money that shareholders promised to pay but haven't paid yet (subscribed capital not yet paid).
    * You always put here: ***Financial Credits***
2.  **Fixed Assets (Immobilizzazioni):**
    *   Assets intended to be used for a long time (more than 1 year).
    *   **Tangible:** Physical things (Machinery, buildings, equipment, land).
    *   **Intangible:** Non-physical things (Software, licenses, patents, R&D costs).
    *   **Financial:** Long-term investments.
        *   *Explanation:* When the company owns shares of another company not to sell them immediately for profit, but to control that company or have a strategic partnership. Also includes long-term loans granted to others.
3.  **Current Assets (Attivo Circolante):**
    *   Assets that stay in the company for less than 1 year.
    *   **Inventory (Rimanenze):** Raw materials, semi-finished products, or final products ready to be sold.
    *   **Receivables (Crediti):** Money owed to us by customers (credits).
    *   **Liquid Funds:** Cash in hand, bank account balance.
4.  **Positive Accruals (Ratei e Risconti Attivi):**
    *   Costs or revenues that span across two fiscal years (accounting adjustments).

### Detailed Analysis of Liabilities (Passivo)
Liabilities are the sources of funding (negative values or debts).

1.  **Net Capital / Equity (Patrimonio Netto):**
    *   **Share Capital:** The money put by owners/shareholders.
    *   **Reserves:**
        *   *Legal Reserve:* By law, a percentage of the annual profit must be put aside here.
        *   *Extraordinary Reserve:* Money put aside voluntarily.
    *   **Profit/Loss:** The result of the current year (before being distributed or put in reserves).
2.  **Provisions for risks and charges (Fondi rischi e oneri):**
    *   Money put aside ("a fund") to cover potential future debts or risks that are certain or likely to happen, but we don't know the exact amount or date yet.
3.  **Employee Termination Indemnity (TFR):**
    *   The "Severance Pay" (*Liquidazione*). The company owes this money to employees when they stop working there. It accumulates every year.
4.  **Debts (Debiti):**
    *   **Financial Debts:** Usually long-term (e.g., Bank Loans / Mutui).
    *   **Current Debts:** Usually short-term (e.g., Debts towards Suppliers).
5.  **Negative Accruals (Ratei e Risconti Passivi):**
    *   Revenues or costs spanning across two years (accounting adjustments).

## 2. Income Statement (Conto Economico)
> **Reference:** Art. 2425 of the Civil Code.

It calculates the **Result of the Fiscal Year** (Profit or Loss). It is an algebraic sum of Revenues and Costs.

| Structure | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A) Value of Production** | Revenues from main activity. |
| **B) Costs of Production** | Costs to generate those revenues. |
| **Difference (A - B)** | *Operating Result (EBIT)* |
| **C) Financial costs and revenues** | Interests and financial income. |
| **D) Value of Adjustment of Fin. Assets** | Revaluations or Write-downs. |
| **Result Before Taxes** | Sum of (A-B +/- C +/- D). |
| **Taxes** | Income taxes. |
| **Final Profit or Loss** | Net Result. |

### A) Value of Production (Revenues)
Represents the total economic value generated by the company.
*   **Sales Revenues:** Money from selling products or services.
*   **Change in Inventory of Finished Products:**
    *   Formula: `Final Stock (FS) - Initial Stock (IS)`.
    *   *Logic:* If **FS > IS** (Positive), it means we produced more than we sold. This surplus production is "value" stored in the warehouse, so it counts as a **Revenue** (Value of Production).

### B) Costs of Production
*   **Raw Materials:** Purchasing material to make products.
*   **Services:** Electricity, consultancy, transport, insurance.
*   **Personnel:** Wages, salaries, and social contributions.
*   **Amortization/Depreciation:** The loss of value of Fixed Assets (machinery) over time.
*   **Change in Inventory of Raw Materials:**
    *   Formula: `Initial Stock (IS) - Final Stock (FS)`.
    *   *Logic:*
        *   If **IS > FS**: We started with a lot of material and ended with little. It means we **consumed** the stock. This is an extra **Cost**.
        *   If **FS > IS**: We bought materials but didn't use them all (we stored them). This reduces the cost for the year (negative cost).

### Result Calculation
1.  **Partial Result (EBIT):** `Value of Production (A) - Costs of Production (B)`.
2.  **C) Financial Area:**
    *   **(-) Bank Interests:** Cost (e.g., interest on loans).
    *   **(-) Bond Interests:** Cost (interest paid to bondholders).
    *   **(+) Active Interests:** Revenue (interest received from bank deposits).
3.  **D) Adjustments:**
    *   Difference between the original purchase cost of a financial asset and its current value (Revaluation/Write-down).
4.  **Final Result:** `Before Tax Result - Taxes = Net Profit (or Loss)`.
